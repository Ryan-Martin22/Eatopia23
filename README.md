[View live project here](https://eatopia.herokuapp.com/)

## **Introduction** 

When initially planning this project I first had to decide on what features the user would need so that I could I could decide on what type of site I was making. I then constructed wireframes to format the design of the site. I then turned my focus to the database models. Planning and preparation was key when constructing this site. 

## **Project Goals**

My goal for this site were to create a user friendly website were people can get inspiration on recipe ideas. The user can create an account to share his or her favourite recipe and also interact with other users recipes. 

## **Site Owner Goals**

* Interact with recipes the may be interested in.
* Provide recipes for users that are budget friendly. 

**User Stories**

*Applies to site users with and/or without account:*
* As a site user I can see a list of recipes so that I can choose which one to view. 
* As a site user I can click on a recipe so that I can view it in full. 
* As a site user I can register an account so that I can have access to the site. 
* As a site user I can like or unlike a recipe so that I can interact with the content. 
* As a site user I can comment recipes so that I can be part of the conversation.  
* As a site user I can view the comments for a recipe so that I can see read the conversation.
* As a site user I can view number of likes for a specific recipe so that I can see which recipes are more popular.
* As I site user I can read about the site to understand what type of recipes will be available and be encouraged to visit the site again. 
* As a site user I can create, read, update and delete posts so that I can manage my content. 
* As a site user I can log in/out so that I can interact with the site.

*Applies to site Admin/SuperUser:*
 * As Admin I can tell site users about delicious,budget friendly recipes so that users will be encouraged to visit the site again.
* As Admin I can create, read, update and delete posts so that I can manage my content.
* As Admin I can delete recipes if inappropiate so that the content of the site is relevant.

**Design Goals**

* A site that works on all devices. 
* Clean and sophisticated design to enhance user experience. 
* Easy to understand and use.
* The style aims to give the user such a good experience that they will want to visit the site again. 

**Design Choices**

* Font

As Font I chose Roboto for all my headings for its simple but yet stylish design. To keep the site neat I chose to use Lato for all other text on the site. 
font-family: 'Roboto', serif;
font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;

* Color Scheme

For the colour scheme I kept it very simple, I used mainly white and light grey. The font is black so it is easily read. As the site with feature a lot of food images I wanted the images to stand out and be the main eye-catcher. When viewing the site i wanted the food to be the main attraction.

- background-color: #F9FAFC;
- background-color: #fff;
- Black: #000000

* Logo Eatopia

I used [canva.com](https://www.canva.com/) to create my logo. I wanted a clean logo that goes well with the content of the site. I wanted a red heart to symbolise the love for food. 

**Wireframes**

Wireframes were used using Balsamiq Wireframes. The aim was to get a basic layout of all the componets to help me in the design process.

# Features #

## Design Features 

### Header
* The header contains the Navigation Bar which remains present on all pages of the site. The Eatopia logo is also located to the left of the Navigation Bar, clicking on the logo will take you back to the home page of the site. Page links are located on the navigation bar and these change depending on whether the user is logged in or logged out. For smaller devices the nabigation bar transforms into a Burger Button which contains the page links. 

### Home Page 
* When visiting the site you are greeted by an image of food and a jumbotron message. Below the image is a prompt for the site user to either login or register on the site. If you are logged in already then the user will be greeted with thier username. 

### Footer
 * The footer is basic and simple as to not distract from the main home page. It contains copyright information and icon links to various social media pages. 

## Existing features

* **Header Logo** appears on every page for consistency and easy navigation, clicking the logo takes you back to the home page. 
* **Header Nav-Bar** appears on every page for consistency and easy navigation, the Nav-Bar toggles on smaller screens for better user experience. The Nav-Bar presents different links if the user is logged in or not.

![Home page image and text](/static/images/welcome.png) 
* **Recipe Cards** are presented on the home page. The cards are paginated by six, i.e if there are more than six recipes on the site they will be displayed on another site. Arrows will point the user in the right direction for good user experience. The cards hold information of the recipe title, author, created on, number of likes and an image. If the user has not chosen a specifik image a placeholder image will be displayed. 
![Recipe Cards](/static/images/recipe-cards.png)

**Future Features**

* **Search Recipes Option**

This would allow users to search for recipes or recipe keywords e.g Chicken recipes. Also if a user enjoys a particular authors recipes they could search for the author name. 

* **Individual Profiles**

This would aloow the user to create a profile about themselves and share information such as cooking tips and preferences. 

* **Video Feature**

This would allow users to upload videos of themselves actually cooking the recipe. Allowing those watching to get a better understanding of cooking the recipe. 

## **Bugs**

* **Bug** - When uploading a recipe I was recieving a TypeError from my views.py file. 

  **Solution** - After discovering that it was a problem occuring during render, I done some research and discovered that the version of Summernote i had installed went out of date. 

* **Bug** - Recieving a NoReverseMatch error when uploading a recipe. 

  **Solution** - After working through my code and adding a recipe in the admin panel. I discovered that whilst adding a recipe through the 'Add Recipe' page, slugs were not been allocated and this was causing the error. I searched on StackOverflow and found a solution and installed Slugify. 

* **Bug** - Recieved a TemplateDoesNotExist error when trying to get my forms to function. 

  **Solution** - After troublehooting and being unable to determine the cause, I reached out to the Tutor team and Rebecca informed me that there was an issue with Crispy Forms 2.0. I then downgraded to a previous version of Crispy Forms and this resolved the error.  

* **Known Bug** - If a user creates a recipe that has the same name of another recipe then an error will be thrown. This is because the slug is generated from the recipe title. To fix this in the future I will research how to make a user create a unique recipe title and in doing so have a uniwue slug, this would prevent the error from occuring.

### Deploying on Heroku
To deploy this page to Heroku from its GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

1. Create the Heroku App:
    - Select "Create new app" in Heroku.
    - Choose a name for your app and select the location.

2. Attach the ElephantSQL postgres database:
    - Create an Instance in ElephantSQL.
    - Copy the URL and paste it into env.py.

3. Prepare the environment and settings.py file:
    - In the Settings tab, click on Reveal Config Vars and copy the url next to DATABASE_URL.
    - In your GitPod workspace, create an env.py file in the main directory. 
    - Add the DATABASE_URL value and your chosen SECRET_KEY value to the env.py file.
    - Add the SECRET_KEY value to the Config Vars in Heroku.
    - Update the settings.py file to import the env file and add the SECRETKEY and DATABASE_URL file paths.
    - Update the Config Vars with the Cloudinary url, adding into the settings.py file also.
    - In settings.py add the following sections:
        - Cloudinary to the INSTALLED_APPS list
        - STATICFILE_STORAGE
        - STATICFILES_DIRS
        - STATIC_ROOT
        - MEDIA_URL
        - DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE
        - TEMPLATES_DIR
        - Update DIRS in TEMPLATES with TEMPLATES_DIR

4. Store Static and Media files in Cloudinary:
    - Create three directories in the main directory; media, static and templates.
    - Create a file named "Procfile" in the main directory and add the following:
        - web: gunicorn project-name.wsgi

5. Deploy to Heroku:
