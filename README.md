## **Introduction** 

When initially planning this project I first had to decide on what features the user would need so that I could I could decide on what type of site I was making. I then constructed wireframes to format the design of the site. I then turned my focus to the database models. Planning and preparation was key when constructing this site.

* The style aims to give the user such a good experience that they will want to visit the site again. 

**Design Choices**

* Font

As Font I chose Roboto for all my headings for its simple but yet stylish design. To keep the site neat I chose to use Lato for all other text on the site. 
font-family: 'Roboto', serif;
font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;

* Color Scheme

For the colour scheme I kept it very simple, I used mainly white and light grey. The font is black so it is easily read. As the site with feature a lot of food images I wanted the images to stand out and be the main eye-catcher. When viewing the site i wanted the food to be the main attraction.

- background-color: #F9FAFC;
- background-color: #fff;
- Black: #000000

* Logo Eatopia

I used [canva.com](https://www.canva.com/) to create my logo. I wanted a clean logo that goes well with the content of the site. I wanted a red heart to symbolise the love for food. 

**Wireframes**

Wireframes were used using Balsamiq Wireframes. The aim was to get a basic layout of all the componets to help me in the design process.
