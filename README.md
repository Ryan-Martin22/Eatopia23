font-family: 'Roboto', serif;
font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;

* Color Scheme

For the colour scheme I kept it very simple, I used mainly white and light grey. The font is black so it is easily read. As the site with feature a lot of food images I wanted the images to stand out and be the main eye-catcher. When viewing the site i wanted the food to be the main attraction.
