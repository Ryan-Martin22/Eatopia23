[View live project here](https://eatopia.herokuapp.com/)

## **Introduction** 

When initially planning this project I first had to decide on what features the user would need so that I could I could decide on what type of site I was making. I then constructed wireframes to format the design of the site. I then turned my focus to the database models. Planning and preparation was key when constructing this site.

**Design Goals**

* A site that works on all devices. 
* Clean and sophisticated design to enhance user experience. 
* Easy to understand and use.
* The style aims to give the user such a good experience that they will want to visit the site again. 

**Design Choices**

* Font

As Font I chose Roboto for all my headings for its simple but yet stylish design. To keep the site neat I chose to use Lato for all other text on the site. 
font-family: 'Roboto', serif;
font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;

* Color Scheme

For the colour scheme I kept it very simple, I used mainly white and light grey. The font is black so it is easily read. As the site with feature a lot of food images I wanted the images to stand out and be the main eye-catcher. When viewing the site i wanted the food to be the main attraction.

- background-color: #F9FAFC;

- Black: #000000

* Logo Eatopia

I used [canva.com](https://www.canva.com/) to create my logo. I wanted a clean logo that goes well with the content of the site. I wanted a red heart to symbolise the love for food. 

**Wireframes**

Wireframes were used using Balsamiq Wireframes. The aim was to get a basic layout of all the componets to help me in the design process.

## **Bugs**

* **Bug** - When uploading a recipe I was recieving a TypeError from my views.py file. 

  **Solution** - After discovering that it was a problem occuring during render, I done some research and discovered that the version of Summernote i had installed went out of date. 

* **Bug** - Recieving a NoReverseMatch error when uploading a recipe. 

  **Solution** - After working through my code and adding a recipe in the admin panel. I discovered that whilst adding a recipe through the 'Add Recipe' page, slugs were not been allocated and this was causing the error. I searched on StackOverflow and found a solution and installed Slugify. 

* **Bug** - Recieved a TemplateDoesNotExist error when trying to get my forms to function. 

  **Solution** - After troublehooting and being unable to determine the cause, I reached out to the Tutor team and Rebecca informed me that there was an issue with Crispy Forms 2.0. I then downgraded to a previous version of Crispy Forms and this resolved the error.  

* **Known Bug** - If a user creates a recipe that has the same name of another recipe then an error will be thrown. This is because the slug is generated from the recipe title. To fix this in the future I will research how to make a user create a unique recipe title and in doing so have a uniwue slug, this would prevent the error from occuring.
