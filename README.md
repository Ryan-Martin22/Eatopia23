## **Introduction** 

When initially planning this project I first had to decide on what features the user would need so that I could I could decide on what type of site I was making. I then constructed wireframes to format the design of the site. I then turned my focus to the database models. Planning and preparation was key when constructing this site.

**Design Goals**

* Easy to understand and use.
* The style aims to give the user such a good experience that they will want to visit the site again. 

**Design Choices**

* Font

As Font I chose Roboto for all my headings for its simple but yet stylish design. To keep the site neat I chose to use Lato for all other text on the site. 
font-family: 'Roboto', serif;
font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;

* Color Scheme

For the colour scheme I kept it very simple, I used mainly white and light grey. The font is black so it is easily read. As the site with feature a lot of food images I wanted the images to stand out and be the main eye-catcher. When viewing the site i wanted the food to be the main attraction.

- background-color: #F9FAFC;
- background-color: #fff;
- Black: #000000

* Logo Eatopia

I used [canva.com](https://www.canva.com/) to create my logo. I wanted a clean logo that goes well with the content of the site. I wanted a red heart to symbolise the love for food. 

**Wireframes**

Wireframes were used using Balsamiq Wireframes. The aim was to get a basic layout of all the componets to help me in the design process.

The Eatopia logo is also located to the left of the Navigation Bar, clicking on the logo will take you back to the home page of the site. Page links are located on the navigation bar and these change depending on whether the user is logged in or logged out. For smaller devices the nabigation bar transforms into a Burger Button which contains the page links. 

### Home Page 
* When visiting the site you are greeted by an image of food and a jumbotron message. Below the image is a prompt for the site user to either login or register on the site. If you are logged in already then the user will be greeted with thier username.

 * The footer is basic and simple as to not distract from the main home page. It contains copyright information and icon links to various social media pages.
